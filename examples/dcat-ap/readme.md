# DCAT-AP

The [DataCatalog vocabulary community](https://www.w3.org/2017/dxwg/wiki/Main_Page) has created a base [application profile](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/semantic-interoperability-community-semic/dcat-ap), with many variations on that profile that have been created for national applications or for specific data types (e.g. geographic data). 

This is a preliminary attempt to express the DCAT-AP in DCTAP. 

* [DCAT-AP in DCTAP](dcat-ap.csv)
* [Configuration file for use with dctap-python](dctap.yml)
* Some output files from dctap-python - [JSON](dcat-ap.json), [YAML](dcat-ap.yml)
