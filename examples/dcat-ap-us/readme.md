# DCAT-AP-US

The DCAT application profile for US government sites.

The documentation for this is at https://resources.data.gov/resources/dcat-us/. The schema is based on the DCAT-AP but is oriented toward JSON. It includes JSON entities like `@type`, which is similar to `rdf:type`. Other properties did not include namespaces but in the TAP most of these have been added from DCAT-AP. Some still are missing namespace prefixes in this TAP version.
