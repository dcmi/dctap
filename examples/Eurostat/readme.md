# Eurostat profile

Eurostat is one of the many data providers using the DCAT-AP. Based on looking at Eurostat data, it uses a subset of DCAT-AP, and makes use of some EU vocabulary lists. These variants can be expressed in a DC TAP allowing for specific validation and processing of the Eurostat data.

The DC TAP presented here makes some guesses regarding cardinality; ideally it would be reviewed by someone close to the data.
