# Presentations and media

There have been two open meetings which were recorded and are available on Youtube. The [February 2021](/2021/Feb18OpenMeeting) provides the most up to date information. There are also files of the slides that were used in the presentations.

There was a poster session at [Code4lib 2021](/code4lib2021) which used a two-page visual description of the creation of a DC TAP.
