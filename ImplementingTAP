# Implementing DC TAP

## Introduction

The DC TAP model is purposely designed to be a simple core for application profiles in tabular form. Although the TAP can be used as is, many implementations of TAP will require extensions to the model. This document addresses some implementation options as examples of use of a profile that has been initially defined in TAP.

## Implementing TAP with a manifest

1. manifest as a configuration file for a piece of software
2. manifest with administrative metadata about the TAP
3. manifest that provides other info that is required by the profile, like the namespace prefixes
