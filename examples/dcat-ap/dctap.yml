# dctap configuration file (in YAML format)

## This module ignores elements (column headers) that are not part of the 
## base DCTAP model unless they are configured here as "extra" elements.
##
## Extra elements must be designated either as "shape" elements (eg, "closed 
## or "start") or as "statement constraint" elements (eg, "min" and "max").
## As extra elements are not supported by this module, their values are 
## simply passed through to the text, JSON, and YAML outputs.

# extra_shape_elements:
# - closed
# - start

extra_statement_constraint_elements:
 - localRange
# - max

## This module has three built-in value node types: "iri", "literal", and "bnode".
## Extra node types can be added here, for example as aliases, such as "uri" for "iri",
## or as combinations of node types, such as "shacl:BlankNodeOrLiteral".
# extra_value_node_types:
# - uri

# Aliases (case-insensitive) mapped to "official" element names (case-sensitive)

## There must be a shape identifier in order to ensure consistency 
## of JSON and YAML output. A different default identifier can be 
## set here, but the module will not permit the identifier to be a 
## string of zero length (and will revert to "default").
# default_shape_identifier: "default"

## The default separator for items in a picklist is a single blank space
## but this could be replaced with other common separators, such as commas 
## or pipes (or-bars). The program routinely strips extra whitespace from 
## the start and end of picklist items.
# picklist_item_separator: ','
